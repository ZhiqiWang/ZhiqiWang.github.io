# VR Experience - Valve Index

Yesterday, I tried my Index first time - although I have receive it for more tna 1 month. That is a long story, but all in all, I finally make it works.

The experience is quite exciting - download steamVR, setup and calibrate Base Stations, update firmware, wear contact glasses lol. Anyway, it spend around 40 min to make it fully works.

## Labs

This is a free but interesting game, including some small games. Quite good, the controllers are totally fun to use. 

## Alyx

The best VR game, it is what we expect. However, the VR is limited by the cable and base stations. I cannot turn and walk 100% freely. However, it is still beyond my expectation. the reaction of the environment is quite real. 

## Beat Saber

The second best VR game. Very enjoyable. 

## Cons

### Visual Quality

I am near-sight, so I have to wear contact glasses. I don't know if it is only for myself, but it feel not so clear, maybe it is my problem. 

### Stability

The visual field tilted from time to time, I think it is because the base station is on the floor. I will try it next time. Hopefully it is not the quality control problem.

## Summary

Valve Index worth the price - expensive, great experience. Maybe next year, Oculus can bring about some amazing stuff, but right now, Valve Index is the best in the market.
