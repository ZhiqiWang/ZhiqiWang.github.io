# Hugo - A Better Choice to Create Blog on GitHub

Hugo is a very fast static webpage generator, which is widely used to create blogs. I found Gridea is not a good choice due to the time zone problem and unpolished language support, although the workflow is quite simple and exactly what I wished for. So I am trying Hugo, a powerful tool but not as simple.

## Quick Start

### Installation
[Doc](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

For Windows platform: 

in PowerShell or CMD

```
scoop install hugo-extended
hugo new site quickstart
cd quickstart
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
```

add `theme = "ananke"` in the last line of `config.toml`

### Add Content

```
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

### Start the Hugo Server

```
hugo server -D
```

### Customize the Theme

Open up `config.toml` in a text editor

```
baseURL = "https://example.org/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My New Hugo Site"
theme = "ananke"
```

## Github Repository Setting

[Hugo Tutorial](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)

1. You must use a `<USERNAME>.github.io` to host your generated content
2. Content from the `master` branch will be used to publish your GitHub Pages site
3. Create a <USERNAME>.github.io GitHub repository for publishing blog generated by Hugo. which is files under `public`. 
4. Push files under `public` to `<USERNAME>.github.io`.
5. blog is available with link `https://<USERNAME>.github.io`. Enjoy!

## Comparison between Gridea and Hugo

-|**Hugo**|**Gridea**
-|-|-
**Pros**|Active community<br>Rich Themes Resources<br>Flexible|**SIMPLE deployment**<br>One desktop app, easy
**Cons**|Need some knowledge about git<br>Manually modify config file<br>Deployment is not as simple<br>Need shell script to automate workflow|timezone bug<br>Community is not as active <br>Themes are not as many<br>Functions are not as many<br>Not so flexible, such as language support

---

## Summary

Overall, I still recommend Gridea to those who want to focus on writing only and accept timezone bug and unpolished language support. But I would move to Hugo as it might be a more powerful tool and would be more reliable as the community is very active.
