    <description><![CDATA[Yesterday, I tried my Index first time - although I have receive it for more tna 1 month. That is a long story, but all in all, I finally make it works.
The experience is quite exciting - download steamVR, setup and calibrate Base Stations, update firmware, wear contact glasses lol. Anyway, it spend around 40 min to make it fully works.
Labs This is a free but interesting game, including some small games.]]></description>
